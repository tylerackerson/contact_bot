Useful in certain situations as argument to\n[`Task.perform`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Task#perform)\nand\n[`Html.App.map`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/latest/Html-App#map).\n\n*Note:* To use this function, its argument need not be literally of type `Never`.\nIt suffices if it is a fully polymorphic value. For example, this works:\n`Process.sleep >> Task.perform never (\\() -> ...)`, because the output of\n[`Process.sleep`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Process#sleep)\nis fully polymorphic in the `x` of `Task x ()`. \n",
